# YAML checker

This is a simple utility that will try to read in a YAML file and print out the
Python representation as a way to check its validity and correctness.

## Installation

* Clone the repo
* Create or activate an environment that you wish to install into.
    - The PyYAML package will be installed if not present.
* Run `python setup.py install` or `python setup.py develop`
* (optional) Copy or link the `yaml-checker` script from the environment
  `bin` directory into one always on your `PATH`.
